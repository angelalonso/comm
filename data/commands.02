{{{

Subkeys can be useful if you don't wish to have your main GPG key
installed on multiple machines. In this way you can keep your
master key safe and have subkeys with expiry periods or which may be
separately revoked installed on various machines. This avoids
generating entirely separate keys and so breaking any web of trust
which has been established.

gpg --edit-key <key ID>

At the prompt type:

addkey

Choose RSA (sign only), 4096 bits and select an expiry period.
Entropy will be gathered.

At the prompt type:

save

You can also repeat the procedure, but selecting RSA (encrypt only).
To remove the master key, leaving only the subkey/s in place:

gpg --export-secret-subkeys <subkey ID> > subkeys
gpg --export <key ID> > pubkeys
gpg --delete-secret-key <key ID>

Import the keys back.

gpg --import pubkeys subkeys

Verify the import.

gpg -K
