- HOW TO USE IT -

--  TO ADD A NEW ENTRY:
python comm.py -i

--  TO SEARCH THROUGH THE ENTRIES:
python comm.py


- RECOMMENDATIONS:

-- Set a keyboard shortcut for each option.

Mines are: 
---   <CTRL> + <SUPER> + C to add a new entry.
---   <CTRL> + <SUPER> + B to search through the entries.

-- You can manually change the contents in commands.txt, just mind the structure:
= title
==== tags
{{{
text line 1
text line 2
...
text line n
}}}
